# Hexagonal-nest
this project is demo for various try.
Basically, main branch will be boilerplate.

# Adapted concepts
## 1. `pnpm` based project
for monorepo adaptation, this project use pnpm as package manager.
(some reason I choose pnpm instead of yarn or npm)

## 2. Hexagonal architecture on server
for scalability, this project's structure adapt hexagonal architecture.
(some reason I choose hexagonal instead of 3-layer)

## 3. MonoRepo
for managing centerized core packages and modules, this project is monorepo
but each sub repositories are repository itself (monorepo - multirepo hybrid)
(some reason I choose monorepo instead of multirepo)
